# Make-Alarm-Application-in-Visual-Studio
It's an alarm app I made.
In the application I made, you enter a minute on the keyboard, for example 1 minute. After the time is up, a song you want from youtube opens on your screen.
Of course, you paste the link you want into the section where the link is entered. I pasted Alpha's Local Troubles song link.
